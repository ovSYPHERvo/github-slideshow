"I'm an ePiC gAm3r. No, really, I've played hundreds upon hundreds of games. I've tried almost every category of video games, besides romantic games, because... just EW. I watch a decent amount of anime. I"m SUPER into Minecraft(Yes, Minecraft). I enjoy a lot of things. I most certainly enjoy hanging out with freinds. I *realy* enjoy playing games like Rocket League, Minecraft, DRG, Apex and Rogue Company."
